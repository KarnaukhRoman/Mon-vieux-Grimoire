# Mon Vieux Grimoire

## Information to Run the Project

- Start the backend from your terminal by following the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file.
- If you want to view and work with both the backend and frontend code, 
  open them in **two separate instances of VS Code** to avoid any conflicts or issues.
